          <p>Countries with higher women's cabinet representation grew GDP 1.8&times; faster on average over the past decade. Nigeria's cabinet is 19% women &mdash; half the global average.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- ========== ARTICLE BODY ========== -->
        <h2>The economic case for women in government</h2>

        <p>When Nigeria's latest cabinet was sworn in, only 9 of 47 ministerial positions went to women &mdash; a share of roughly 19%. While this marked a modest improvement over the previous administration's 14%, it remains dramatically below the global average of 35% and the African continental average of 24%.</p>

        <p>But this isn't just a matter of fairness. A growing body of evidence suggests that excluding women from political decision-making has measurable economic consequences.</p>

        <h2>What the cross-country data shows</h2>

        <p>Analysis of World Bank and UN Women data across 30 countries over the period 2010&ndash;2023 reveals a striking pattern: nations that increased women's share of cabinet positions by 10 percentage points or more experienced average GDP growth rates 1.8 times higher than those where representation stagnated or declined.</p>

        <p>The correlation is not proof of direct causation, but researchers point to several transmission mechanisms. Women in cabinet are more likely to champion policies on education, health and social protection &mdash; areas where investment generates strong economic multiplier effects. They also tend to prioritise budget accountability, reducing leakage in public spending.</p>

        <h2>Nigeria's specific cost</h2>

        <p>Nigeria's GDP reached $574 billion in 2023, making it Africa's largest economy. Yet its score on the WEF Gender Gap Index dropped two places to 124th out of 146 countries. The political empowerment sub-index &mdash; which measures women in parliament, ministerial positions and years with a female head of state &mdash; is where Nigeria performs worst.</p>

        <p>The data suggests this isn't coincidental. Countries at similar income levels but with higher women's political representation &mdash; South Africa, Kenya, Ethiopia &mdash; have outperformed Nigeria on key development indicators including primary school completion, maternal mortality and budget execution rates for social programmes.</p>

            <strong>Nigeria's 2025 Global Gender Gap rank</strong> &mdash; down two places from the previous year, driven by declines in political empowerment.
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>The policy connection</h2>

        <p>Research by the African Development Bank found that gender-responsive budgeting &mdash; an approach more commonly championed by women legislators &mdash; improved public spending efficiency by 15&ndash;20% in countries where it was adopted. Nigeria's gender-responsive budgeting framework, established in 2012, remains largely unenforced.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, BudgIT's analysis of the 2024 federal budget showed that only 50% of funds earmarked for women-focused programmes were actually disbursed. The gap between allocation and execution is a recurring pattern that advocates say reflects the absence of women's voices in budget negotiations.</p>

        <h2>What needs to change</h2>

        <p>The African Union's Agenda 2063 calls for 50% women's representation in all decision-making bodies by 2063. At Nigeria's current trajectory, it would take over 80 years to reach gender parity in the national assembly.</p>

        <p>Advocates point to several levers that could accelerate progress: constitutional quotas (as adopted by Kenya and Rwanda), party-level gender policies, campaign finance support for women candidates, and stronger enforcement of the National Gender Policy. None of these are new ideas &mdash; but the economic data now provides a compelling utilitarian argument to supplement the moral one.</p>
